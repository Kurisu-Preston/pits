# PITS
**PITS: Variational Pitch Inference without Fundamental Frequency for End-to-End Pitch-controllable TTS**

**Abstract**: Previous pitch-controllable text-to-speech (TTS) models rely on directly modeling fundamental frequency, leading to low variance in synthesized speech. To address this issue, we propose PITS, an end-to-end pitch-controllable TTS model that utilizes variational inference to model pitch. Based on VITS, PITS incorporates the Yingram encoder, the Yingram decoder, and adversarial training of pitch-shifted synthesis to achieve pitch-controllability. Experiments demonstrate that PITS generates high-quality speech that is indistinguishable from ground truth speech and has high pitch-controllability without quality degradation. Code and audio samples will be available at https://github.com/anonymous-pits/pits.

**Training code is uploaded.**

**Demo and Checkpoint are uploaded at** [Hugging Face Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/anonymous-pits/pits)ðŸ¤—

Audio samples are uploaded at [github.io](https://anonymous-pits.github.io/pits/).

For the pitch-shifted Inference, we unify to use the notation in scope-shift, s, instead of pitch-shift.

Preprint version contains some errors! Please wait for the update!

## Preprocess 
prepare filelist train.list/val.list

support chinese[ZH] japanese[JA] english[EN] korean[KO]  
  
fix requirements.txt  
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
```
python setup.py build_ext --inplace
```
```
python preprocess.py 
```

## Config
+ you need to modify speakers list in config/config_cjke.yaml
+ you can also modify the **keep_ckpts** and **log_path**
+ **data_path** is the root path of your data.

## Training
download the pretrained checkpoint
```
wget https://huggingface.co/spaces/anonymous-pits/pits/resolve/main/logs/pits_vctk_AD_3000.pth
```
fine tuning the pretrained checkpoint
```
python train.py -c configs/config_cjke.yaml -m cjke -t logs/pits_vctk_AD_3000.pth
```
training from scratch
```
python train.py -c configs/config_cjke.yaml -m cjke
```
resume from previous training checkpoint
```
python train.py -c configs/config_cjke.yaml -m cjke -r logs/cjke/cjke_3000.pth
```
